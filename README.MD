# SimplyCpp #

SimplyCpp is a very simple to use IDE for C++ Language, that is intended for students who are very new to the field of programming. This is programmed because they need to focus more on the syntax rather than understanding the complex build tools and IDEs.

This program uses [TDM-GCC-32](http://tdm-gcc.tdragon.net/) as the compiler, which is a modified (patched) version of MinGW compiler for windows and is included in the installer.

This also uses [FastColoredTextBox](https://github.com/PavelTorgashov/FastColoredTextBox) for syntax highlighting.
