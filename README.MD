# SimplyCpp

SimplyCpp is a very simple to use IDE for C++ Language, that is intended for students who are very new to the field of programming. This is programmed because they need to focus more on the syntax rather than understanding the complex build tools and IDEs.

I'm remaking the editor in C++ wxWidgets because wxAUI gives more control than standard WinForms, and also allows for the application to be compiled and run on a Mac.

## Old program (current release)

This is the old screenshot, of the old program. The original version is written using .NET WinForms in C#, and uses the FCTB control for syntax highlighting. The newer in development version will support multi-file projects and muti-document editing as well.

This program uses [TDM-GCC-32](http://tdm-gcc.tdragon.net/) as the compiler, which is a modified (patched) version of MinGW compiler for windows and is included in the installer.
